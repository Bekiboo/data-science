## Elevator pitch
_This dataset provides the birth names by year in the US and by state. It allows us to easily find trends and compare names.
Here we show that it can be used to determine the probable age of someone according to their age. We can also use it to look at a group of names with a common charasteritic (e.g. Christian names), and compare their usage. Finally, we used it to show that movies can have a significant impact of birth names._

```{python}
# | label: Birth names by year with counts for US states as well
# | code-summary: Read project data

# Read the data from the project repository on GitHub, write it to a local file, then store it in a dataframe called "df".
url = "https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4dwellings/raw/master/data-raw/dwellings_neighborhoods_ml/dwellings_neighborhoods_ml.csv"
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.text
    with open("dwellings_neighborhoods_ml.csv", "w") as file:
        file.write(data)
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data from the URL")

# df = pd.read_csv("names_year.csv")

# duplicate_rows = df[df.duplicated(subset=["name", "year"], keep=False)]

# if not duplicate_rows.empty:
#     print("Duplicate rows found:")
#     print(duplicate_rows)
# else:
#     print("No duplicate rows found.")

## QUESTION|TASK 2
__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.__

_TODO_

## QUESTION|TASK 3
__Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.__

_TODO_

```{python}
# | label: Q3

```

## QUESTION|TASK 4
__Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.__
