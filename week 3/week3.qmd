# | label: Monthly Airline Delays by Airport for US Flights, 2003-2016
# | code-summary: Read project data

## QUESTION|TASK 1
__Which airport has the worst delays?__
<!-- Discuss the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours. -->

_The airport with the worst delays is San Francisco International. 
By multiplying the proportion of delayed flights in an airport by the average delay time, we obtain the probable time one traveller might expect their flight to be delayed (before knowing if their flight is going to be delayed)._

```{python}
# | label: Q1
# | code-summary: Aggregates and analyzes airport flight delay data

# create a new dataframe where we aggregate the data by "airport_name"
# and sum the values of "num_of_flights_total", "num_of_delays_total",
# "minutes_delayed_total".
dfWorstDelays = (
    df.groupby(["airport_name"])
    .agg(
        {
            "num_of_flights_total": "sum",
            "num_of_delays_total": "sum",
            "minutes_delayed_total": "sum",
        }
    )
    .reset_index()
)

# create new column "proportion_delayed" with num_of_flights_total and num_of_delays_total
dfWorstDelays["proportion_delayed"] = (
    dfWorstDelays["num_of_delays_total"] / dfWorstDelays["num_of_flights_total"]
)

# create new column "average_delayed_hours" with num_of_delays_total and minutes_delayed_total
dfWorstDelays["average_delayed_hours"] = (
    dfWorstDelays["minutes_delayed_total"] / dfWorstDelays["num_of_delays_total"]
) / 60

# create new column "probable_delayed_hours" with proportion_delayed and average_delayed_hours
dfWorstDelays["probable_delayed_hours"] = (
    dfWorstDelays["proportion_delayed"] * dfWorstDelays["average_delayed_hours"]
)

# display a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours. Sort by average_delayed_hours
dfWorstDelays.sort_values(
    by=["probable_delayed_hours"], ascending=False
).head().reset_index(drop=True)

```


## QUESTION|TASK 2
__What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length?__
<!-- Discuss the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.) -->

_TODO._

```{python}
# | label: Q2
# | code-summary: calculates the probable delayed hours for each month and creates a chart to visualize the results

# remove rows where Month variable  is "n/a"
dfBestMonth = df[df["month"] != "n/a"]

dfBestMonth = (
    dfBestMonth.groupby(["month"])
    .agg(
        {

            "minutes_delayed_total": "sum",
        }
    )
    .reset_index()
)

# create new column "proportion_delayed" with num_of_flights_total and num_of_delays_total
dfBestMonth["proportion_delayed"] = (
    dfBestMonth["num_of_delays_total"] / dfBestMonth["num_of_flights_total"]
)

# create new column "average_delayed_hours" with num_of_delays_total and minutes_delayed_total
dfBestMonth["average_delayed_hours"] = (
    dfBestMonth["minutes_delayed_total"] / dfBestMonth["num_of_delays_total"]

## QUESTION|TASK 3
__According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:__

-100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather
-30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather.
-From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%.__



```{python}
# | label: Q3
# | code-summary: gf

dfWeather = df

# get mean of "num_of_delays_late_aircraft" column
meanLate = dfWeather["num_of_delays_late_aircraft"].mean()

# when Late Aircraft variable equals "-999", replace with the mean
dfWeather["num_of_delays_late_aircraft"] = dfWeather[
    "num_of_delays_late_aircraft"
].replace(-999, meanLate)

# create new column "num_of_delays_all_weather" with the sum of "num_of_delays_late_aircraft" * .3 + "num_of_delays_weather" + "num_of_delays_nas" * .4 (if month is between April and August) or "num_of_delays_nas" * .65 (if month is not between April and August), round down to the nearest integer
dfWeather["num_of_delays_all_weather"] = (
    dfWeather["num_of_delays_late_aircraft"] * 0.3
    + dfWeather["num_of_delays_weather"]
    + dfWeather["num_of_delays_nas"]
    * np.where(
        dfWeather["month"].isin(["April", "May", "June", "July", "August"]),
        0.4,
        0.65,
    )
).astype(int)

dfWeather.head(5)

## QUESTION|TASK 4
__Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Discuss what you learn from this graph.__

_TODO._

```{python}
# | label: Q4
# | code-summary: dfdg

# create a new dataframe where we aggregate the data by "airport_name"
# and sum the values of "num_of_flights_total", "num_of_delays_all_weather".
dfWeather = (

        }
    )
    .reset_index()
)

# TODO: remove nameless airports

# list all airports, truncate after the first comma
dfWeather["airport_name"] = dfWeather["airport_name"].str.split(",").str[0]

# create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport.
chart = (
    alt.Chart(dfWeather)
    .encode(
        x=alt.X("airport_name", title="Airport"),

    )
    .mark_bar()
    .properties(
        title="Proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport"
    )
)

```


## QUESTION|TASK 5
__Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value.__
